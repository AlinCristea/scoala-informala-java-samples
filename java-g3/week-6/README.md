# Bank payments

A user can have multiple bank accounts.
A user can have cards emitted to some of the bank accounts.
When the user pays with the card at a POS he receives a receipt if the transaction was successful. Otherwise the POS shows an error message.
A user can use his card to withdraw money from an ATM. The ATM can show messages or emit receipts for all the possible messages. Same as with POS.
